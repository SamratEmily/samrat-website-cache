== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with WooCommerce? =

Yes! The plugin comes with pre-configured exclusions for WooCommerce cart, checkout, and my-account pages. It also excludes pages when WooCommerce cart cookies are present.

= Will caching break my dynamic content? =

By default, the plugin excludes logged-in users from caching. If you have specific pages with dynamic content, add them to the "Exclude Pages" list in settings.

= How do I clear the cache? =

You can clear the cache in several ways:
1. Click "Clear All Cache" button on the settings page
2. Click "Cache > Clear Cache" in the admin bar
3. The cache automatically clears when you update posts or pages

= Does this work with other caching plugins? =

We recommend using only one page caching plugin at a time to avoid conflicts. Disable other caching plugins before activating Samrat Website Cache.

= Is the minification safe? =

The minification is designed to be safe and only removes unnecessary whitespace and comments. It preserves content in `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<textarea>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` tags. However, if you experience any issues, you can disable minification individually for HTML, CSS, or JS.

= How do I exclude a page from caching? =

Go to Website Cache > Settings, find the "Exclude Pages" field, and add the URL path (one per line). For example:
* `/contact/` - Excludes the contact page
* `/api/*` - Excludes all URLs starting with /api/

= Does this plugin support multisite? =

The plugin works on multisite installations, but each site needs to be configured individually.

= How can I verify the cache is working? =

View the page source of a cached page. At the bottom, you'll see a comment like:
`<!-- Cached by Samrat Website Cache on 2024-01-15 10:30:00 -->`

You can also check the response headers for `X-Samrat-Cache: HIT`.
